Sorting Algorithms

1. Insertion Sort -- 	Start from 0 and check if it is smaller than any value to its left and swap.
			If arr[4] = 3 and arr[2] = 7 so at index [4] it iterates till 0 to find if any value bigger than it exists.
			When reaches to index [2] it find "7" which is 7>4 so replaces arr[2]=3 and arr[4]=7.

2. Merge Sort ---	Breaks the unsorted list and then merges the sorted list. https://www.interviewbit.com/tutorial/merge-sort-algorithm/
